# Titanic-survival-prediction
The RMS Titanic was known as the unsinkable ship and was the largest, most luxurious passenger ship of its time. Sadly, the British ocean liner sank on April 15, 1912,
killing over 1500 people while just 705 survived.
In this dataset, we will analyze the Titanic data set and make two predictions. One prediction to see which passengers on board the ship would survive and then another prediction
to see if we would’ve survived.
Variable Definition Key:- 
survival Survival 0 = No, 1 = Yes pclass Ticket class 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd sex Sex Age Age in years sibsp # of siblings  
spouses aboard the Titanic parch # of parents  children aboard the Titanic ticket Ticket number fare Passenger fare cabin Cabin number embarked Port of Embarkation C = Cherbourg,
Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton Variable Notes pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES) 1st = Upper 2nd = Middle 3rd = Lower
age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way... Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)
parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way... Parent = mother, father Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson Some children travelled only with a nanny, 
therefore parch=0 for them.
